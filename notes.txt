This CSS declaration grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr); creates a grid container with two columns of equal width, where each column will occupy an equal portion of the available space within the container.
The repeat() function is used to define a repeating pattern for the grid columns, and it takes two arguments: the first argument specifies the number of times the pattern should be repeated, and the second argument defines the size of each grid track. In this case, the pattern is repeated twice and the size of each track is set to 1fr, which means that each column will occupy an equal fraction of the available space in the grid container.
The fr unit stands for "fractional unit" and is a flexible unit that allows the grid tracks to scale according to the available space. So, in this case, each column will take up half of the available space in the grid container.
